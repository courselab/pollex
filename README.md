# Pollex

_Pollex: (noun) the thumb._

**Pollex is an app for community hitchhiking.**

## About

The last class has just finished and your ready to walk home.

If only some colleague in the campus could you give you a lift...

As luck would have it, you've signed up for pollex in your community.

Pick the smartphone, log in as a kitchhiker and find that a good fellow is kindly offering a hide.

And if it's you that's on wheels, log in as a driver and announce a seat on your vehicle.

Handy for walkers, cool for drivers, sustainable for the environment.

You may set up pollex for your community-only usage, making it safe and practical.
